# Student Grade Management System

**Complexity:** Medium
**Time Estimate:** 10 hours

---

## Project Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Apply OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) to design Java classes and interfaces for real-world problems
- Create well-structured applications integrating primitive data types, control structures, and custom objects
- Analyze class relationships to choose between inheritance, composition, abstract classes, and interfaces
- Evaluate code quality using proper encapsulation, naming conventions, and OOP best practices
- Apply polymorphic behavior with method overriding to build flexible, extensible code

---

## What You'll Build

A console application for managing student grades with these features:

### Core Features

- **Add Student** – Register new students in the system
- **View Students** – Display all students with their details
- **Record Grade** – Add grades for students in different subjects
- **View Grade Report** – Display grade history for a student
- **Simple Menu** – Navigate through options

### Student Types

| Type | Details |
|---|---|
| Regular Student | Standard grading (passing grade: 50%) |
| Honors Student | Higher standards (passing grade: 60%, eligible for honors recognition) |

### Subject Types

| Type | Details |
|---|---|
| Core Subject | Mandatory subjects (Mathematics, English, Science) |
| Elective Subject | Optional subjects (Music, Art, Physical Education) |

## OOP Principles

- Private fields with public getters/setters
- Inheritance (`Student` & `Subject` hierarchies)
- Abstract classes and methods
- Interface implementation (`Gradable`)
- Method overriding (`displayStudentDetails`, `getStudentType`, etc.)
- Polymorphism (treating `RegularStudent` and `HonorsStudent` as `Student`)
- Composition (`StudentManager` has Student array, `GradeManager` has Grade array)
- Static members (Student counter, Grade counter)

---

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Points | What We're Looking For |
