# Student Grade Management System -Advanced

---

## Project Objectives
### Time Estimate : 6–7 hours

By completing this project, you will be able to:

* Design and implement type-safe data structures using Java Collections Framework and generics to efficiently manage complex student and grade data, selecting optimal collection types based on performance requirements and access patterns
* Implement modern file I/O operations using NIO.2 API and Stream processing to handle multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, binary), with proper resource management and functional transformations for data import/export
* Create comprehensive input validation using regular expressions to validate student IDs, email addresses, phone numbers, and other structured data formats, ensuring data integrity across the system
* Design and implement thread-safe concurrent operations for background tasks such as batch processing, automated report generation, and real-time statistics updates using appropriate synchronization strategies and Executor framework
* Optimize application performance by analyzing collection performance characteristics, implementing efficient data access patterns, and ensuring thread safety in multi-threaded operations

# What You’ll Build

An enterprise-grade Student Grade Management System with:

## New Features

### Advanced Data Management

* HashMap for O(1) student lookup
* TreeMap for sorted GPA rankings
* HashSet for unique course tracking

### Multi-Format File Support

* CSV, JSON, Binary export/import using NIO.2

### Regex-Based Validation

* Student ID, email, phone, date, course codes

### Concurrent Report Generation

* Thread pools for batch processing

### Real-Time Statistics Dashboard

* Background thread updates every 5 seconds

### Automated Grade Processing

* Scheduled GPA updates & notifications

### Advanced Search with Regex

* Pattern-based student queries

### Batch Operations

* Parallel bulk processing

### Data Caching System

* Thread-safe caching with eviction policy

### Audit Trail

* Concurrent logging system
